Welcome to #Snapgram! - Meltjac Techs' Evolving Journey on GitHub
This repository is a chronicle of Meltjac Techs' exploration and development of Snapgram, a social media platform buzzing with potential. Here, you'll find documentation, code snippets, and reflections on our progress as we build #Snapgram! into a vibrant online community.

What is #Snapgram!

#Snapgram! is a social media platform with a focus on authenticity, connection, and creativity. We envision a space where users can freely express themselves, engage in meaningful conversations, and discover diverse perspectives. Unlike traditional platforms driven by algorithms and engagement metrics, #Snapgram! prioritizes genuine human interaction and user control.

Why are we building #Snapgram?

Meltjac Techs believes that the current social media landscape lacks genuine connection and fosters echo chambers. We're passionate about creating a platform that empowers users to:

Share their true selves without the pressure of curated perfection.
Connect with others who share their interests and values.
Engage in meaningful conversations that go beyond fleeting likes and comments.
Discover new perspectives and challenge their own viewpoints.
